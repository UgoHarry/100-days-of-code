# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1:  03 January, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Learning the new features and concepts of ES6.

**Thoughts:** Was supposed to start with the JavaScript30 challenge, but realised that the challenges are based on ES6 (ES2015) which I haven't made myself familiar with. I'll picking up on that first, and will then move on to JavaScript30

**Today's Progress**: Still learning the new features on ES6.

**Thoughts:** Hoping to round up on ES6 tomorrow and move on to JavaScript30
